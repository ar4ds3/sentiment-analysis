What you do when you have a bunch of verbatim or a feedback? 
There are plethora of options that you can do with a descriptive information, but the first step would be to understand the content.
Analyzing the comments/ tweets/ feedback showcases the emotion of a person sharing the information, and this could be derived as potential lead to a business, a corrective mechanism, or an enhancement idea.
The Machine Learning models like Random Forest Classifier, Multinomial NB, and Logistic Regression were used in this project to analyze the sentiment of the user.
The concept of vectorization was used for parsing the input characters, Voting classifier with SMOTE was considered to treat the imbalance and to derive the best probable output (whether the text has a positive or negative sentiment).
